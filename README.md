# blueberry-signal
Blueberry Signal is the working title for a racing game where you can lose traction with a button press. The goal with this project is to make a cool racing game with 3-4 maps that I could finish within, like, a year.

Things are still pretty early now - refer to the <Wiki>[https://github.com/TobastinWasTaken/blueberry-signal/wiki] for all the planning deets.
